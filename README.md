# GenMedi

A generic drug is a medication created to be the same as an already marketed brand-name drug in dosage form, safety, strength, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics, and intended use.

Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Pariyojana Kendra (PMBJPK) have been set up to provide generic drugs, which are available at lesser prices but are equivalent in quality and efficacy as expensive branded drugs.

#### Observations:

One needs to know drug's composition to find out which generic drug serves the purpose.
Doctor prescriptions mostly have only the drug name and strength, which is not enough to retrieve the correct generic drug code.

#### Objective of this project:

Given name of the drug, one will get all the other available alternative branded drugs and drug code of the generic medicine  with same composition.
